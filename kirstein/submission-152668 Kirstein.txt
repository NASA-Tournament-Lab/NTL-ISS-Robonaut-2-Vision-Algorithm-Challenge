
1) component search method for Sim
I used a specific method for images in Sim. 
I check the difference between R, G and B to determine if the image is in SIM.
The function "rec_sim" start from line 7466 is the main method for Sim.
Firstly, I try to find the most large component with the color of red. 
Then I use flood fill method from the pixels around the red component to find the panel and determine the boundary of panel. 
Then, calculate the cross points of the boundary lines. The cross points are the corners of the panel.
With the corners of the panel, I can find the transformation parameter and determine the positions of all components. Parameters from line 7468 to line 7493 are the positions extracted from one image. 
function "locate_points" calculate the transformation parameter and locate all components needed on target image. It uses lsqr method, which is an open source code http://www.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr.html 
I slightly adjust the position of A01 switch by finding the black pixels around. See function "local_black_button_search". 

2) component search method for Lab1, lab2, Lab3 and ISS
I used sift feature to match the target image and the template images.
I choose ten images (lab/left_AJBB, lab/right_BQJW, lab/left_TPMO, lab/right_OWNI, lab2/right_RAPC, lab2/right_ZMXP, lab2/left_PMGZ, lab3/left_HTOG, lab3/left_URDX, lab3/left_LUKC) as the templates and find there sift feature.
line 1039 to 3502 is from siftpp (http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/siftpp.html ) , which is an open source SIFT detector.
line 3511 to 6868 is the information of ten image templates.
the function "mymatch" is a greedy method to match the sift feature of target image and template images.
the function "randmatch" randomly choose four matched pairs to calculate the transformation parameters and check the whether there are many other matched pairs on the position of all components.

3) adjust the position of red cover.
I slightly adjust the position of red cover by finding the red pixels around. See function "local_red_cover_search".

4) function "check_led" start from line 7110 check if the LED is on. It mainly check the brightness of the pixels. The status of the switches are then determined by the LED status.
