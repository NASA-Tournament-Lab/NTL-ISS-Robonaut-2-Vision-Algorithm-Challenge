4) Why did you decide to compete in this challenge? “It is not the first time I take part in a contest ; this is always a very good experience, and each time I think it improves my general approaches to problems.More specifically, I participated in the Robonaut challenge because I love robot and space related themes. I am fond of science fiction movies and taking part to this contest really gave me the impression I was contributing to the future ; and who knows, maybe some of my concepts and lines of code will be sent to the ISS inside the Robonaut! I hope our different approaches will help NASA improve Robonaut 2 and the lives of men and women working in the ISS. This contest was a fantastic experience for me and I don't doubt I will participate to future challenges.”
